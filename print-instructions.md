Organic supports work well on this design. Use a small flat-head screwdriver to pry them off as one piece.

If you have a multi-head printer like the Prusa XL, you can also print the top-layer of the supports with a different material, so they are easier to remove (e.g. holder in PLA, top layer of supports in PETG).
