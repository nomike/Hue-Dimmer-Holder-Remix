# Hue Dimmer Holder Remix

A remix of https://www.printables.com/model/148770-hue-dimmer-holder.

The original design had some issues for me: The magnets didnÂ´t hold the dimmer in place strong enough and the slope in the insert made the dimmer slide out of the holder.

This remix removes the slopes from the insert, which should make the dimmer stay in place better. I also made the holes for the magnets a bit deeper, so that the magnets are closer to the dimmer switch, which should increse their holding force. I added some slope to those holes, so that the magnets could be removed more easily.

The Wall Mount is relying on the wall boxes to be mounted absolutely level. As this is not the case in my flat, I did not use it and decided to use double sided tape instead. But I didn't touch the connector holes, so it should still work with the original wall mount if you prefer.

The script directly imports the original STL file and manipulates the object within, so I included it in the repository. The original file is licensed under the Creative Commons 4.0 - Attribution - NonCommercial license and can be downloaded via the link above.
